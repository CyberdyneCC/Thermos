### What's Thermos?
Thermos is a fork of KCauldron, a craftbukkit forge server for Minecraft 1.7.10. After periods of inactivity on KCauldron's GitLab concerning major issues, Thermos was created to allow active members of the Minecraft coding community to optimize it and provide fixes in a timely manner.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Thermos experience.

Advantages over KCauldron:
+ Lag-lowering optimizations
+ Better world protection (Forge stuff doesn't bypass Bukkit plugins!)
+ Many patches that KCauldron didn't get from Spigot
+ Dupe glitch fixes
