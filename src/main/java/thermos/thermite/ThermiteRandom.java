/**
 * A subclass of java.util.random that implements the Xorshift random number
 * generator
 *
 * - it is 30% faster than the generator from Java's library - it produces
 * random sequences of higher quality than java.util.Random - this class also
 * provides a clone() function
 *
 * Usage: XSRandom rand = new XSRandom(); //Instantiation x = rand.nextInt();
 * //pull a random number
 *
 * To use the class in legacy code, you may also instantiate an XSRandom object
 * and assign it to a java.util.Random object: java.util.Random rand = new
 * XSRandom();
 *
 * for an explanation of the algorithm, see

     * <p>The hedge "approx
     * imately" is used in the foregoing description only because the next
     * method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen
     * bits. If it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits, then the
     * algorithm shown would choose {@code int} values from the stated range
     * with perfect uniformity.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm is slightly tricky. It rejects values that would result in
     * an uneven distribution (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible by n).
     * The probability of a value being rejected depends on n. The worst case is
     * n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 1/2, and the expected
     * number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially: it
     * returns the correct number of high-order bits from the underlying
     * pseudo-random number generator. In the absence of special treatment, the
     * correct number of <i>low-order</i> bits would be returned. Linear
     * congruential pseudo-random number generators such as the one implemented
     * by this class are known to have short periods in the sequence of values
     * of their low-order bits. Thus, this special case greatly increases the
     * length of the sequence of values returned by successive calls to this
     * method if n is a small power of two.
